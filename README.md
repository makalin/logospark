# **LogoSpark**

An AI-powered web application to brainstorm project names, generate unique logos, and customize them in real-time.

## **The Problem**

Coming up with a great brand identity is hard. You need a catchy name and a professional logo that fits your vision. Traditional logo generators are often template-based and lack originality, while working with a designer is time-consuming and expensive.

## **The Solution**

**LogoSpark** is an all-in-one identity toolkit. It uses generative AI to help you from the very first step (thinking of a name) to the last (exporting a production-ready logo).

It's built on the idea of "AI-assisted creation," where the AI provides the creative spark, and you provide the final direction and customization.

## **Core Features**

* **🤖 AI Project Namer:** Can't think of a name? Enter a few keywords (e.g., "Real estate, smart, analytics") and our AI will brainstorm a list of unique, brandable names.  
* **✨ Multi-Logo Generation:** Powered by Google's Imagen 3, LogoSpark generates 4-6 distinct logo concepts from a single text prompt. No more "one-and-done" results.  
* **🎨 Live Customization:** Pick a logo you like and jump into the editor.  
  * **Color Control:** Change background, primary, and accent colors with an intuitive color picker.  
  * **Typography:** Add your project name and tagline. Choose from 50+ hand-picked Google Fonts.  
  * **Layouts:** Instantly toggle between different logo layouts (icon on top, icon on the left, etc.).  
* **🚀 Export Ready:** Download your final logo as a high-resolution, transparent-background PNG or a scalable SVG, ready for your website, app, or GitHub profile.

## **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React (Vite)  
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
* **AI (Images):** Google's Imagen 3 API
